# PocketCoffea

## Introduction

PocketCoffea is a slim analysis framework based on Coffea for CMS NanoAOD events.

The goal of the framework is to define an HEP analysis in a declarative way where possible (with a well defined
configuration file), and with python code where customization is needed (by defining new coffea processors).

PocketCoffea defines a customizable structure to process NanoAOD events and define weights, categories, histograms. This
is done thanks to a `BaseProcessor` class which defines a `workflow` of operations to go from NanoAOD to histograms.
The user can customize the process from the configuration file or by redefining well-defined steps in the workflow.

The framework handles cleanly the analysis's parameters and metadata, separing in a transparent way the definition of an
analysis phase space and metadata from CMS groups, and an analysis's run configuration.
